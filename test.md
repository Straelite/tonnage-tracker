### Ongoing Todos
* Allow retrieval of lifts by date/type or both (options!)
* Allow ability to delete lifts being uploaded.
* Allow deletion of stored lifts
* Create tracking graphs

### Big picture goals
* The ability to add my lifts and get a trend over time using calculated 1rm 
    ** could do this via calculating 1rm for all sets and taking best
    ** or by taking 1rm for all sets and taking average - ideally one, else dissuades tracking warmups
* The ability to track daily 'tonnage' based on workouts (all reps * sets)
